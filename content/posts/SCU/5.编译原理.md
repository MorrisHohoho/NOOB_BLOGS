# 编译原理与实现 2023 Spring

## About
* Lab1-C minus Lexical Analyzer
* Lab2-C minus parser

These labs are so easy that I can't learn a lot from them, so I choose to use NJU Labs to replace them.

## Notes

the most difficult of this lab is learning how to use Flex and Bison properly. For some students, those who have soild background in programming, this lab is quite easy for them. But for me, it's my first time to read the English manual to find solution, step by step, and write these codes independently. Honestly, really challenging for me. But after almost 20 hours of struggle, I finally did it! Congraulations!

## TODO

* [X] data structure of multinode tree, which is used to store the syntax analysing tree
* [X] pass the testing samples
* [X] support octal and hexdecimal
* [X] support scientific notation
* [X] convert non-decimal to decimal
* [ ] a more precise error recovery in order to report as many errors as the parser can.
