# About
These are my notes for my self-learning materials. I am inspired strongly by(both in Chinese):

- [交大生存手册](https://survivesjtu.gitbook.io/survivesjtumanual/)

- [CSDIY](https://csdiy.wiki/CS%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92/)


Knowledge is open to everyone. Thanks to all providers for your amazing resources.
